# Zig Package tool

a command line tool to work with `build.zig` dependencies and build graphs.

It embeds custom build runners to retrieve build graph information,
used to backup dependencies, output a graphviz `dot` file etc.

The repo vendors zig's `build-runner.zig` with an inserted hook
to serialize the `std.Build` struct to `zon` and send it from the subpocess stdout
back to `zigpkg`.
Then that information is used to perform operations based on the build graph.

It is compatible and requires with zig 0.14.0 upwards at runtime, when zig master
starts making changes to the build runner the vendored runner needs to be versioned
inside this tool.

## Usage

```
> zig build
> ./zig-out/bin/zigpkg --help
# or:
> zig build zigpkg -- --help
usage: zigpkg <subcommand> [--help]

stores all dependencies of a directory containing build.zig.zon in a .tar.gz archive

available subcommands:
  dot     rerun "zig build" and output a graphviz ".dot" file of all build steps
  zon     rerun "zig build" with a custom build runner and output the build graph as .zon to stdout
  deppkg  more subcommands for creating and working with "deppkg.tar.gz" files storing all
          dependencies required to build a zig package

environment variables:

  ZIG: path to the zig compiler to invoke in subprocesses. defaults to "zig".
```

## Dependency packages

The "deppkg create" subcommand generates a single archive containing all dependencies
zig fetches for same arguments you would provide to "zig build".

The file can be verified with the "deppkg extract" subcommand, which repacks the
individual dependencies into temporary tar archives, loads them back into zigs
package cache with "zig fetch", and compares the hash generated by zig with the
archive.

So when releasing a zig project with dependencies, you can include the deppkg
archive as a complete source distribution that is buildable even when upstream
dependencies become unavailable for whatever reason.

Be aware that not all lazy dependencies may be fetched depending on the provided
arguments (and even the "native target" if some host build steps switch out dependencies
based on it).
This means the user is to provide build options that will fetch all dependencies
he expects to be in the package.

## Graphviz dependency graph

this executes `zig build` with a custom build runner (including potiential additional arguments),
to convert the `Build.Step` graph to basic graphviz `dot` code.
that can be easily be converted to the svg form.
For now, generated dot strings are not escaped and might break.

Since the build graph is dependent on the original invocation of `zig build`,
integration into the build system is not easy. It's easier to build `zigpkg`
manually, and invoke `zigpkg dot <build_root>` with the same arguments
as `zig build`.

```bash
# cli
./zig-out/bin/zigpkg dot . install | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```

![Build Graph](graph.svg?sanitize=true)

```zig
// build.zig usage
// - the disadvantage here is, `dotGraphStep` basically reruns `zig build`,
//   and passes the extra arguments down, but does not know about the original arguments.
// - svgGraph is a system "dot" command
const zig_pkg_tool = @import("pkg_tool");
const svggraph = zig_pkg_tool.svgGraph(b, zig_pkg_tool.dotGraphStep(b, &.{
    "install", // extra args zig build, e.g. targets
    "dot",
    "test",
    "run",
}).captureStdOut());
b.step("dot", "install graph.svg").dependOn(&b.addInstallFile(
    svggraph,
    "graph.svg",
).step);
```
